    <!--We have used CDN links to get react in our page
    What is CDN and why it is used-->
<!-- A Content Delivery Network (CDN) is a distributed network of servers that work together to deliver content (like images, videos, and static files) to users faster and more efficiently.

These servers, called edge servers, which are strategically positioned across various geographical locations.
CDNs help improve the performance, reliability, and scalability of websites and web applications by caching content closer to users, reducing latency, and offloading traffic from origin servers.

How does Content Delivery Network(CDN) Work?
User sends a request for content (e.g., an image) from a website.
CDN identifies the user's location and routes the request to the nearest edge server.
If the content is cached at the edge server, it is delivered directly to the user.
If the content is not cached, the edge server retrieves it from the origin server, caches it locally, and delivers it to the user.
Cached content is stored at the edge server for future requests, optimizing performance and reducing latency. -->

<!-- What is crossorigin?
Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) is an HTTP-header based mechanism that allows a server to indicate 
any origins (domain, scheme, or port) other than its own from which a browser should permit loading resources. 
CORS also relies on a mechanism by which browsers make a "preflight" request to the server hosting the cross-origin 
resource, in order to check that the server will permit the actual request. 
In that preflight, the browser sends headers that indicate the HTTP method and headers that will be used in the actual request.

How crossorigin works?
When you make a cross-origin request, this is the request-response process:

The browser adds an origin header to the request with information about the current origin's protocol, host, and port
The server checks the current origin header and responds with the requested data and an Access-Control-Allow-Origin header
The browser sees the access control request headers and shares the returned data with the client application -->
